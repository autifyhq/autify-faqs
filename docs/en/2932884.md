Autify can search for an alternative element by AI if an exact match is not found. This is called Autify AI, or Autify Maintenance AI.

To explain the search process briefly...

- Fixed time (this can be changed from settings, but default is 30 seconds)
- Wait for an exact match to appear. If it does not appear, AI search will begin.

<br>Please see [the release notes for 2019/11/07](https://docs.autify.com/ja/2019/11/07/release/) for details on what you need to check.

Autify's AI is getting better every day. Look forward to the future evolution.
