Autify does not record the scroll operation, but generally it automatically scrolls to the operation target element/detection target element without any special settings or operations. <br>If it does not scroll, another problem may be the cause so please contact us.

If you want to scroll explicitly to a specific position, you can do it with JavaScript. For details, please refer to the following page:
