title: 特定のステップの失敗を無視することはできますか？
desc:

Yes, it is possible! <br>You can select how to handle the failure at each step from the following three patterns.

If the test fails,

1. テストを終了する
2. This step is seen as an error and continue the test
3. Ignore and continue the test

In 2, the test continues, but the fact that it failed is not ignored, so if the step fails, the entire test is treated as a failure even if there is no other step that failed and the test was executed to the end. <br>In 3, since the failure is ignored, the entire test will be treated as a success if there are no other failed steps and was executed to the end, even if the step fails.
