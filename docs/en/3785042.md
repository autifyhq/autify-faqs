title: Can I change the test start URL in bulk?
desc: Scenario, URL, bulk change

Currently it is not possible to change the start URL of the test specified in step 1 in bulk, but we plan to develop this function in the future.

We would appreciate it if you could let us know which of the following test cases occur more frequently:

1. Scenarios where it is sufficient to change all URLs
2. A scenario in which the information used in the scenario (such as the account information used for login and the content of the data pattern given by the "data" function) must also be changed along with the URL.
