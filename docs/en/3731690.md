If you make a transition by directly changing the URL field of the browser, it will not be recorded. However, there is a function on the recorder that makes a transition by directly specifying the URL, and by using it, it is possible to a record the operation of moving to another site.

On Autify's recorder, click the 4th arrow icon from the left. The input dialog to enter the URL of the transition destination will be displayed. Please enter the destination.

<br>The transition by clicking this icon is only necessary when you want to record.

If you have already recorded the transition of the site and want to perform additional recording, enter it directly in the URL field of the browser and transition.
