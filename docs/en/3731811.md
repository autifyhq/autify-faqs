In Autify, scrolling operations are not recorded as steps, but you can verify and operate on elements that do not appear in First View. <br> Therefore, you generally don't have to worry about scrolling when creating a scenario.

If you want to explicitly scroll for any reason, such as infinite scrolling, you can do so with JavaScript. <br>

## Method

Open the scenario details, insert a JS step where you want to make the assertion, and write the code for scrolling. <br>[Please refer to this snippet](https://github.com/autifyhq/autify-javascript-snippets/blob/master/snippets/scroll.js).
