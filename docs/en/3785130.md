title: It seems that when the test is executed for the first time, it takes longer than the second time. Why is this?
desc: First time, execution time, slow

The behavior of Autify is that the test process is not changed between the first execution and the second and subsequent executions.

If the characteristics of the elements (position, color, text, id, class, etc) change and is not an exact match, it can take longer.

Also, although it is unlikely, the element search AI is currently undergoing major improvement. This may have an impact.
