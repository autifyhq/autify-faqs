It is currently not possible to merge multiple existing scenarios. Instead, the scenario created in the step group can be used as the first step of a newly created scenario. <br>If the first step is the same, such as the login operation, please create it in the step group.

#### Method of operation

1. Click on the step group and then click and record the new step group on the upper right corner

3. Start recording <br>

Regarding the step group, we plan to release the following in the future:

- Apply step groups to existing scenarios
- Make it possible to add grouped steps even at the end or middle of a scenario
