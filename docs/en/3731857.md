You can test multiple data patterns in one scenario by using the function called "data". <br>

## Procedure

#### 1. Prepare a csv that describes the data pattern you want to execute.

```
surname,given name,email,company name,size of company,error message Sato,Makiko,makiko@autify.com,Autify," 1-10","This email address has too many recent signup requests"satoh,makiko,${EMPTY},test," 5,000+","Please input your email address"sato,ma,makiko+nocompanyname@autify.com,${EMPTY}," 201-500","Please input your company name"
```

**The value in the first line will be available as the variable name** at each step of the scenario. <br>**The character code of the file must be UTF-8**. It is possible to write no value by writing `<br>${EMPTY}`. <br>

One line is treated as one data pattern, and in the case of the above sample, three data patterns are given.

It cannot be combined with the value set on another line.

For the above CSV, for example, a combination such as <br>`sato,makiko,makiko+nocompanyname@autify.com, ........` <br> is not executed.

If you want to execute with this pattern, please add the pattern as a new line. <br>

#### 2. Click ï¸™ on the right side of the Save button on the scenario details screen, and click Add data.

#### 4. Modify so that the CSV value is referenced in the step where you want to use the data pattern.

If you click the thumbnail of the step you want to use the value given in CSV and open the step details and change from **specify value** to **data**, the value described in the first line of CSV will be displayed in the pull-down. <br> By specifying the name of the column you want to use, you will be able to use the CSV value described in that column.

- **Input step**
- **Validation steps for text**
- **Step specifying the URL**

Values can be used in fields such as the above.

#### 5. Click "Save".

Click the "Save" button on the upper right of the screen to save the edited contents. <br>**If you forget to save it, you will have to restart from CSV upload!**

Now you can test multiple data patterns together in one scenario. <br>

In scenarios where data was uploaded, **all configured patterns will be tested**. <br> In the sample CSV presented above, three patterns of data are registered, so the **test is executed three times** . <br>

## Tips

It is not necessary to use all set columns, so it is possible to prepare and use the columns for explanation as follows.
