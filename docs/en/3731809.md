title: It's hard to find the desired scenario. Do you have any advice for naming scenarios?
desc: scenario

As the number of test scenarios increases as you continue to use Autify, finding the desired scenario becomes difficult. Since the scenario list screen supports search by scenario name,

it will be easier to find the desired scenario **by including the information you want to use for narrowing down scenarios.**

#### Useful information to include

- An outline for understanding the contents of the scenario
- Person responsible for the scenario
- PC/SP
- Normal/abnormal
- Test item number

And so on.

If you have any unique tips for naming, please share them with us!

In the first half of 2020, Autify is aiming to release an improvement for not only scenarios but also lists such as schedules and test results. <br> We plan to greatly enhance the sorting and filtering functions.
