title: What is the maximum number of steps per scenario?
desc: Scenario, upper limit
---

Currently, there is no functional limit, but we have set **200 steps as the upper limit of support**.

This is because not only will the the screen display and test execution of Autify be slow if there are many steps, but the following problems will occur.

If there are many test steps...

- The test becomes complicated and it becomes difficult to understand the contents of the test scenario ** <br> and maintainability is reduced. **
- If a failure occurs early in the test, the rest will not run ** <br> and there is a high risk that the required tests cannot be performed. **

If you create a scenario that includes all test viewpoints A, B, C, and D, and <br><strong data-md-type="double_emphasis">if failure occurs at A, none of B, C, and D will be executed. <br><strong data-md-type="double_emphasis">Also, by incorporating multiple perspectives,</strong> it becomes difficult to understand what you want to do at which step</strong>.

Therefore, it is recommended not to incorporate multiple viewpoints in one scenario, but to **create an independent scenario for each test viewpoint** so that each viewpoint can be tested without being affected by the failure of another viewpoint. <br>

今後機能的な制限を行う可能性もありますので、「どうしても必要な操作だけで200ステップを超えてしまう」といった場合はご連絡いただけますと幸いです。<br>
