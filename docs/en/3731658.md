Autify takes a screenshot of the screen at each step, so it tends to take longer than Selenium.

Also, Autify has a function that the AI searches for a substitute element when an element with exact match is not found. The process is as follows:

1. After looking for an exact match for a certain amount of time (30 seconds by default),
2. AI find alternative elements.

For sites that tend to have incomplete matches, such as when ids are changed frequently, AI tends to work and as a result, tends to be slower. <br>In that case, it can be improved by shortening the time to keep searching for the exact match element, so please contact support.

Please refer to [this article](https://app.intercom.io/a/apps/xdpe6msj/articles/articles/2932884/show) for a brief explanation of Autify's AI.
