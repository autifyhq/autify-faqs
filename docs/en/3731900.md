Yes. <br>

With Autify, if you upload the file upload as usual, it will be recorded naturally and you can replace the file to be used later.

To replace a file, open the details of the step by clicking the thumbnail of the step that is performing the file upload operation you want to replace from the scenario edit screen.

The files used for file uploads are stored on Amazon S3. <br>

**Limitations**

- IE Edge is not supported
- The file name is up to 255 bytes <br> *Because it is UTF-8, the number of bytes differs depending on the character. Basic Japanese is 3 bytes.
- Up to 10MB per file
- Up to 80MB per scenario

There are no limitations on the file format.

If you find the above restrictions inconvenient, please contact support.
