The “waiting step” that can be inserted into an Autify test scenario supports **up to 600 seconds (10 minutes)**.

However, Autify automatically waits for a certain amount of time until an element appears, so it is rarely necessary to set a sleep with the intention of adjusting the appearance timing of the element.

For more details, please see [can I add wait and sleep?](https://intercom.help/autify/ja/articles/3731724-%E3%82%A6%E3%82%A7%E3%82%A4%E3%83%88%E3%82%84%E3%82%B9%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%97%E3%81%AF%E5%85%A5%E3%82%8C%E3%82%89%E3%82%8C%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99%E3%81%8B)
