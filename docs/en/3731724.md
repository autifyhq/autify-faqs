title: Can I add wait and sleep?
desc: Standard function, Sleep, Wait

It is possible to sleep for a certain period of time by adding a waiting step.

However, Autify automatically waits for a certain period of time until an element appears and the operation or verification set in that step becomes possible, so it is almost never necessary to set sleep with the intention of adjusting the appearance timing of the element.

There are two main cases where it is better to sleep using the wait step:

1. If page loading takes a long time
2. When an unexplained failure occurs immediately after page transition

<br> More specifically, "If page loading takes a long time" means:

- It takes a long time to load, and it times out while running tests
- It does not time out, but the loading widget blocks the operation so it does not work properly
- It is necessary to wait for the backend processing that cannot be judged from the screen

<br> "When an unexplained failure occurs immediately after page transition" refers to failures such as the following. These failures tend to occur when redirects occur on page transitions.

- It fails at the JS step immediately after the page transition for some reason
- It fails in the verification of URL and title immediately after page transition for some reason<br>
