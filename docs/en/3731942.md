On Autify, you can check out the following types of histories.

1. **Test result history**
2. **Scenario execution history**
3. **Change history of scenarios**

The test result history records which version of which scenario was executed, and as long as the original scenario is not deleted, you can check the status of the scenario at the time of execution. <br>You can also duplicate a scenario from a previous version of the scenario.

You can check each as follows.
