## Password Policy

The password for Autify accounts is described in the [introduction](https://docs.autify.com/ja/getting-started). <br> Please refer to it.

*For the password of the site you want to test using Autify, please contact the administrator of the site.

## Handling of Passwords

In order to run the test with Autify, if you are going to:

- Set up the ID and password for BASIC authentication
- Record the ID/password input operation of the account used on the test site

these values are ** held in a restorable condition** because they need to be used during the test run.

Also, generally, if we receive an inquiry such as "Could not be recorded" or "Failed for some reason," we often borrow the input value set in the** test scenario and manually perform the same operation** in order to investigate the cause. <br> <br>Therefore, **we strongly recommend that you prepare an account for test execution **.
