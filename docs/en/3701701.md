If the Autify site is:

- Not displaying screenshots of scenarios or test results
- Not displaying the icon indicating the execution status
- The layout of the entire site is broken

it may be due to the release that is done daily. <br> Most of the problems can be solved by Super Reload, so please try it.

#### How to Super Reload

**[Windows]**

Ctrl + F5

**[Mac]**

command + shift + R

<br> If the problem is not solved after doing a Super Reload, the cause may be due to a problem with Autify. Please contact customer support.
