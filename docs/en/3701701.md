If the Autify site is:

- Not displaying screenshots of scenarios or test results
- Not displaying the icon indicating the execution status
- サイト全体のレイアウトが崩れている

it may be due to the release that is done daily. <br> Most of the problems can be solved by Super Reload, so please try it.

#### How to Super Reload

　Ctrl + F5

**【mac】**

　command + shift + R

<br> If the problem is not solved after doing a Super Reload, the cause may be due to a problem with Autify. Please contact customer support.
