title: What does "Review Needed" mean?
desc: AI

"Review Needed" is a state in which an element that exactly matches the element to be operated or verified cannot be found, and AI has found a substitute element.

Please read [this article](https://docs.autify.com/ja/2019/11/07/release/#%E8%A6%81%E7%A2%BA%E8%AA%8D%E3%83%90%E3%83%83%E3%82%B8) for further information.

見つけた要素が正しい場合は**「成功とする」**をクリックすることでテストシナリオがアップデートされます。この操作を長期間せずにいるとテストシナリオがアップデートされないため、仕様変更が積み重なっていくとどこかのタイミングで追随できなくなってしまいます。<br>

It doesn't have to be every time, but we would appreciate it if you could **select "Success" if the elements found by AI were correct**. <br>

The screenshots taken at each step are taken as a record of the test run, and this **image is not used to decide "Review Needed"**.

Therefore, even if there is a difference between the image of this execution result and the image of the previous execution (or recording), it will not be "Review Needed" if the element to be operated or verified is properly found.
